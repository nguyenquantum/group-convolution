# group-convolution
This repository contains the implementation of the integral equation solving application (Section 7 and Appendix D) of our quantum group convolution algorithms. To reproduce the figures in Appendix D of our paper, run the functions `plot_solution()` and `plot_error()` in integral_convolve.py
